-As a client, I want to be able to use this application quickly and efficiently.

-The interface should be as simplistic as possible so as to allow me to easily access my current agenda!
-The goals that are in progress should be displayed in an easily perceivable fashion so I can quickly assess their situation.
-The goals that have been achieved should also be stored separately in another list so I can browse over my achievements if I desire.
-The application should be quick, responsive and stable!
 
 -As a client, I want to use this application to help me organize my goals and to be easily informed about their state of completion.

-The menu should be user-friendly so as to allow for quick and fluid navigation.
-The menu which allows me to add goals should be versatile enough so as to allow me the freedom to customize the type of goal (examples: Name of the goal, 
Choice between Numeric goal or Yes/No goal, Category(Maybe), Begin from & Completion by, Maybe include an option which shows the goals currently in progress along with a motivational 
slogan after the phone screen is turned off for more than 5 hours, so as to account for my sleep) and offering me incentive every morning to pursue their completion.
-The application's architecture should constantly inform me about my incomplete goals so as to offer constant motivation...also I would like it to have an option to deactivate the feature.
